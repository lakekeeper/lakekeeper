# Docker-Compose
This directly contains the main `docker-compose.yaml` to run Lakekeeper with docker compose. It also contains overlays for other configuration. The compose file does not include object storage. For fully self-contained setups for experimentation, please check our [Examples](../examples/README.md). In contrast to our examples, this compose setup is designed to accessible from outside the docker network.

For information on how to run this compose setup, please check the ["Docker-Compose" section of the Getting Started Guide](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/getting-started/#option-2-docker-compose).
