# Open Policy Agent (OPA)
[Lakekeeper's Open Policy Agent bridge](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/tree/main/authz/opa-bridge) enables compute engines that support fine-grained access control via Open Policy Agent (OPA) as authorization engine to respect privileges in Lakekeeper. We have also prepared a self-contained [Docker Compose Example](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/tree/main/examples/trino-opa) to get started quickly.

Let's imagine we have a trusted multi-user query engine such as trino, in addition to single-user query engines like pyiceberg or daft in Jupyter Notebooks. Managing permissions in trino independently of the other tools is not an option, as we do not want to duplicate permissions across query engines. Our multi-user query engine has two options:

1. **Catalog enforces permissions**: The engine contacts the Catalog on behalf of the user. To achieve this, the engine must be able to impersonate the user for the catalog application. In OAuth2 settings, this can be accomplished through downscoping tokens or other forms of Token Exchange.
2. **Compute enforces permissions**: After contacting the catalog with a god-like "I can do everything!" user (e.g. `project_admin`), the query engine then contacts the permission system, retrieves, and enforces those permissions. Note that this requires the engine to run in a trusted environment, as whoever has root access to the engine also has access to the god-like credential.

The Lakekeeper OPA Bridge enables solution 2, by exposing all permissions in Lakekeeper via OPA. The Bridge itself is a collection of OPA files in the `authz/opa-bridge` folder of the Lakekeeper GitHub repository.

The bridge also comes with a translation layer for trino to translate trino to Lakekeeper permissions and thus serve trinos OPA queries. Currently trino is the only iceberg query engine we are aware of that is flexible enough to honor external permissions via OPA. Please [let us know](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/issues/new/choose) if you are aware of other engines, so that we can add support.

## Configuration
Lakekeeper's OPA bridge needs to access the permissions API of Lakekeeper. As such, we need a technical user for OPA (Client ID, Client Secret) that OPA can use to authenticate to Lakekeeper. Please check the [Authentication guide](./authentication.md) for more information on how to create technical users. We recommend to use the same user for creating the catalog in trino to ensure same access. In most scenarios, this user should have the `project_admin` role.

The plugin can be customized by either editing the `configuration.rego` file or by setting environment variables. By editing the `configuration.rego` files you can also easily connect multiple lakekeeper instance to the same trino instance. Please find all available configuration options explained in the file.

If configuration is done via environment variables, the following settings are available:

| Variable                                 | Example                                                             | Description |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_URL`</nobr>            | <nobr>`https://lakekeeper.example.com`<nobr>                        | URL where lakekeeper is externally reachable. Default: `https://localhost:8181` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`</nobr> | `http://keycloak:8080/realms/iceberg/protocol/openid-connect/token` | Token endpoint of the IdP used to secure Lakekeeper. This endpoint is used to exchange OPAs client credentials for an access token. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_CLIENT_ID`</nobr>      | `trino`                                                             | Client ID used by OPA to access Lakekeeper's permissions API. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_CLIENT_SECRET`</nobr>  | `abcd`                                                              | Client Secret for the Client ID. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_SCOPE`</nobr>          | `lakekeeper`                                                        | Scopes to request from the IdP. Defaults to `lakekeeper`. Please check the [Authentication Guide](./authentication.md) for setup. |

All above mentioned configuration options refer to a specific Lakekeeper instance. What is missing is a mapping of trino catalogs to Lakekeeper warehouses. By default we support 4 catalogs in trino, but more can easily be added in the `configuration.rego`.

| Variable                                       | Example                   | Description |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`TRINO_DEV_CATALOG_NAME`</nobr>          | <nobr>`dev`<nobr>         | Name of the development catalog in trino. Default: `dev` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_DEV_WAREHOUSE`</nobr>        | <nobr>`development`<nobr> | Name of the development warehouse in lakekeeper that corresponds to the `TRINO_DEV_CATALOG_NAME` catalog in trino. Default: `development` |
| <nobr>`TRINO_PROD_CATALOG_NAME`</nobr>         | <nobr>`prod`<nobr>        | Name of the development catalog in trino. Default: `prod` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_PROD_WAREHOUSE`</nobr>       | <nobr>`production`<nobr>  | Name of the development warehouse in lakekeeper that corresponds to the `TRINO_PROD_CATALOG_NAME` catalog in trino. Default: `production` |
| <nobr>`TRINO_DEMO_CATALOG_NAME`</nobr>         | <nobr>`demo`<nobr>        | Name of the development catalog in trino. Default: `prod` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_DEMO_WAREHOUSE`</nobr>       | <nobr>`demo`<nobr>        | Name of the development warehouse in lakekeeper that corresponds to the `TRINO_DEMO_CATALOG_NAME` catalog in trino. Default: `demo` |
| <nobr>`TRINO_LAKEKEEPER_CATALOG_NAME`</nobr>   | <nobr>`lakekeeper`<nobr>  | Name of the development catalog in trino. Default: `lakekeeper` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER_LAKEKEEPER_WAREHOUSE`</nobr> | <nobr>`lakekeeper`<nobr>  | Name of the development warehouse in lakekeeper that corresponds to the `TRINO_LAKEKEEPER_CATALOG_NAME` catalog in trino. Default: `production` |

When OPA is running and configured, set the following configurations for trino in `access-control.properties`:
```yaml
access-control.name=opa
opa.policy.uri=http://<URL where OPA is reachable>/v1/data/trino/allow
opa.log-requests=true
opa.log-responses=true
opa.policy.batched-uri=http://<URL where OPA is reachable>/v1/data/trino/batch
```
