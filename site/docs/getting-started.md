# Getting Started

There are multiple ways to deploy Lakekeeper. Our [self-contained examples](#option-1-examples) are the easiest way to get started and deploy everything you need (including S3, Query Engines, Jupyter, ...). By default, compute outside of the docker network cannot access the example Warehouses due to docker networking.

If you have your own Storage (e.g. S3) available, you can deploy Lakekeeper using [docker compose](#option-2-docker-compose), deploy on [Kubernetes](#option-3-kubernetes), deploy the pre-build [Binary](#option-4-binary) directly or [compile Lakekeeper yourself](#option-5-build-from-sources).

## Deployment

### Option 1: üê≥ Examples
!!! note

    Our docker compose examples are not designed to be used with compute outside of the docker network (e.g. external Spark).

All docker expose examples come with batteries included (Identity Provider, Storage (S3), Query Engines, Jupyter) but are not accessible (by default) for compute outside of the docker network.

=== "üê≥ With Authentication & Authorization"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper
    cd docker-compose/access-control
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

=== "üê≥ Without Authentication"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper
    cd docker-compose/minimal
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

Then open your browser and head to `localhost:8888` to load the example Jupyter notebooks or head to `localhost:8181` for the Lakekeeper UI.


### Option 2: üê≥ Docker Compose
For a Docker-Compose deployment that is used with external object storage, potentially an external Database and an external Identity Provider, we recommend to start from the [Example](#option-1-examples) closest to your use-case, and start modifying the compose file according to our [User Guides](./docs/nightly/docs/configuration.md).


### Option 3: ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes
We recommend deploying the catalog on Kubernetes using our [Helm Chart](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper-charts/tree/main/charts/lakekeeper). Please check the Helm Chart's documentation for possible values. To enable Authentication and Authorization, an external identity provider is required.

A community driven [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper-operator) is currently in development.


### Option 4: ‚öôÔ∏è Binary
For single node deployments, you can also download the Binary for your architecture from [Github Releases](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/releases). A basic configuration via environment variables would look like this:

```bash
export LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ="postgres://postgres_user:postgres_urlencoded_password@hostname:5432/catalog_database"
export LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE="postgres://postgres_user:postgres_urlencoded_password@hostname:5432/catalog_database"
export LAKEKEEPER__PG_ENCRYPTION_KEY="MySecretEncryptionKeyThatIBetterNotLoose"

./lakekeeper migrate
./lakekeeper serve
```

To expose Lakekeeper behind a reverse proxy, most deployments also set:
```bash
export LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI=<https://<Url-where-Lakekeeper-is-externally-reachable>
```
The default `LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI` is `https://localhost:8181`.

### Option 5: üë®‚Äçüíª Build from Sources
To customize Lakekeeper, for example to connect to your own Authorization system, you might want to build the binary yourself. Please check the [Developer Guide](./docs/nightly/docs/developer-guide.md) for more information. 

## First Steps

Now that the catalog is up-and-running, the following endpoints are available:

1. `<LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI>/ui/` - the UI - by default: [http://localhost:8181/ui/](https://localhost:8181/ui/)
1. `<LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI>/catalog` is the Iceberg REST API
1. `<LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI>/management` contains the management API
1. `<LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI>/swagger-ui` hosts Swagger to inspect the API specifications

### Bootstrapping
Our self-contained docker compose examples are already bootstrapped and require no further actions.

After the initial deployment, Lakekeeper needs to be bootstrapped. This can be done via the UI or the bootstrap endpoint. Among others, bootstrapping sets the initial administrator of Lakekeeper and creates the first project. Please find more information on bootstrapping in the [Bootstrap Docs](docs/nightly/bootstrap.md).

### Creating a Warehouse
Now that the server is running, we need to create a new warehouse. We recommend to do this via the UI.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Create a Warehouse](assets/create-warehouse-v1.png){ width="100%" }
  <figcaption>Create a Warehouse via UI</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


Alternatively, we can use the REST-API directly. For an S3 backed warehouse, create a file called `create-warehouse-request.json`:

```json
{
  "warehouse-name": "my-warehouse",
  "storage-profile": {
    "type": "s3",
    "bucket": "my-example-bucket",
    "key-prefix": "optional/path/in/bucket",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "sts-role-arn": "arn:aws:iam::....:role/....",
    "sts-enabled": true,
    "flavor": "aws"
  },
  "storage-credential": {
    "type": "s3",
    "credential-type": "access-key",
    "aws-access-key-id": "...",
    "aws-secret-access-key": "..."
  }
}
```

We now create a new Warehouse by POSTing the request to the management API:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8181/management/v1/warehouse -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @create-warehouse-request.json
```

If you want to use a different storage backend, see the [Storage Guide](docs/nightly/storage.md) for example configurations.

### Connect Compute

That's it - we can now use the catalog:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pyspark

SPARK_VERSION = pyspark.__version__
SPARK_MINOR_VERSION = '.'.join(SPARK_VERSION.split('.')[:2])
ICEBERG_VERSION = "1.6.1"

# if you use adls as storage backend, you need iceberg-azure instead of iceberg-aws-bundle
configuration = {
    "spark.jars.packages": f"org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-{SPARK_MINOR_VERSION}_2.12:{ICEBERG_VERSION},org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-aws-bundle:{ICEBERG_VERSION}",
    "spark.sql.extensions": "org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions",
    "spark.sql.defaultCatalog": "demo",
    "spark.sql.catalog.demo": "org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog",
    "spark.sql.catalog.demo.catalog-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.rest.RESTCatalog",
    "spark.sql.catalog.demo.uri": "http://localhost:8080/catalog/",
    "spark.sql.catalog.demo.token": "dummy",
    "spark.sql.catalog.demo.warehouse": "my-warehouse",
}
spark_conf = pyspark.SparkConf()
for k, v in configuration.items():
    spark_conf = spark_conf.set(k, v)

spark = pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder.config(conf=spark_conf).getOrCreate()

spark.sql("USE demo")

spark.sql("CREATE NAMESPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_namespace")
print(f"\n\nCurrently the following namespace exist:")
print(spark.sql("SHOW NAMESPACES").toPandas())
print("\n\n")

sdf = spark.createDataFrame(
    pd.DataFrame(
        [[1, 1.2, "foo"], [2, 2.2, "bar"]], columns=["my_ints", "my_floats", "strings"]
    )
)

spark.sql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS demo.my_namespace.my_table")
spark.sql(
    "CREATE TABLE demo.my_namespace.my_table (my_ints INT, my_floats DOUBLE, strings STRING) USING iceberg"
)
sdf.writeTo("demo.my_namespace.my_table").append()
spark.table("demo.my_namespace.my_table").show()
```
