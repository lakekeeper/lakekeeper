# Next Steps

The catalog is evolving quickly. Especially internal rust APIs are not stable and subject to change. External REST APIs are kept as stable as possible, especially the `/catalog` API is stable as of today.

- **Release 0.5.0**: Our biggest release yet is coming early November. It includes **Fine Grained Access Control**, a first simple **UI** and much more.
- **Release 0.6.0**: With Release 0.6.0 we focus on stabilizing some of our most recent features and significantly improve our **Docs**. Docusaurus is coming!

# Quickstart

A Docker Container is available on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/lakekeeper/lakekeeper?tab=info).
We have prepared a self-contained docker-compose file to demonstrate the usage of `spark` with our catalog:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper.git
cd lakekeeper/examples/self-contained
docker compose up
```

Then open your browser and head to `localhost:8888`.

For more information on deployment, please check the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

# Scope and Features

The Iceberg Catalog REST interface has become the standard for catalogs in open Lakehouses. It natively enables multi-table commits, server-side deconflicting and much more. It is figuratively the (**TIP**) of the Iceberg.

We have started this implementation because we were missing customizability, support for on-premise deployments and other features that are important for us in existing Iceberg Catalogs. Please find following some of our focuses with this implementation:

- **Customizable**: Our implementation is meant to be extended. We expose the Database implementation, Secrets, Authorization, EventPublishing and ContractValidation as interfaces (Traits). This allows you to tap into any Access management system of your company or stream change events to any system you like - simply by implementing a handful methods. Please find more details in the [Customization Guide](CUSTOMIZING.md).
- **Change Events**: Built-in support to emit change events (CloudEvents), which enables you to react to any change that happen to your tables.
- **Change Approval**: Changes can also be prohibited by external systems. This can be used to prohibit changes to tables that would invalidate Data Contracts, Quality SLOs etc. Simply integrate with your own change approval via our `ContractVerification` trait.
- **Multi-Tenant capable**: A single deployment of our catalog can serve multiple projects - all with a single entrypoint. All Iceberg and Warehouse configurations are completely separated between Warehouses.
- **Written in Rust**: Single 30Mb all-in-one binary - no JVM or Python env required.
- **Storage Access Management**: Built-in S3-Signing that enables support for self-hosted as well as AWS S3 WITHOUT sharing S3 credentials with clients. We are also working on `vended-credentials`!
- **Well-Tested**: Integration-tested with `spark`, `pyiceberg`, `trino` and `starrocks`.
- **High Available & Horizontally Scalable**: There is no local state - the catalog can be scaled horizontally and updated without downtimes.
- **Openid provider integration**: Use your own identity provider to secure access to the APIs, just set `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` and you are good to go.
- **Fine Grained Access (FGA) (Coming soon):** Simple Role-Based access control is not enough for many rapidly evolving Data & Analytics initiatives. We are leveraging [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) based on googles [Zanzibar-Paper](https://research.google/pubs/zanzibar-googles-consistent-global-authorization-system/) to implement authorization. If your company already has a different system in place, you can integrate with it by implementing a handful of methods in the `AuthZHandler` trait.

Please find following an overview of currently supported features. Please also check the Issues if you are missing something.

# Multiple Projects / Multi-Tenancy

Lakekeeper can host multiple independent projects that each host multiple warehouses. The overall
structure looks like this:

```
<project-1-uuid>/
├─ foo-warehouse
├─ bar-warehouse
<project-2-uuid>/
├─ foo-warehouse
├─ bas-warehouse
```

Each Project in Lakekeeper corresponds to a distinct Application Object within your IdP, enabling genuine Multi-Tenancy. A single instance of Lakekeeper can host multiple Projects, ensuring separation at all levels, including Authentication. Our Multi-Tenancy definition is broader than most catalogs. While other catalogs may consider hosting multiple warehouses under a single IdP Application as Multi-Tenancy, a single Lakekeeper Project can achieve that and more.

As this additional layer isn't necessary for most deployments, the `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_DEFAULT_PROJECT` configuration option is set to true by default. This setting effectively disables multi-tenancy by defaulting to a project with the NIL UUID ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000") as the project-id.

To enable multi-project setups, simply set `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_DEFAULT_PROJECT` to `false`. Multi-project setups require additional configuration to include project-ids in HTTP headers and separate authentication audiences. This documentation does not cover these steps yet. Of course, hosting multiple warehouses within a single Lakekeeper Project is also possible.

# Undrop Tables

When a table or view is dropped, it is not immediately deleted from the catalog. Instead, it is marked as dropped and a job for its cleanup is scheduled. The table, including its data if `purgeRequested=True`, is then deleted after the configured expiration delay has passed. This will allow for a recovery of tables that have been dropped by accident.

`Undrop` of a table is only possible if soft-deletes are enabled for a Warehouse.

# Configuration

The basic setup of the Catalog is configured via environment variables. As this catalog supports a multi-tenant setup, each catalog ("warehouse") also comes with its own configuration options including its Storage Configuration. The documentation of the Management-API for warehouses is hosted at the unprotected `/swagger-ui` endpoint.

Following options are global and apply to all warehouses:

### General

Previous to Lakekeeper Version `0.5.0` please prefix all environment variables with `ICEBERG_REST__` instead of `LAKEKEEPER__`.

| Variable                             | Example                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI`               | `https://example.com:8080` | Base URL where the catalog is externally reachable. Default: `https://localhost:8080`                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_DEFAULT_PROJECT` | `true`                     | If `true`, the NIL Project ID ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000") is used as a default if the user does not specify a project when connecting. This option is enabled by default, which we recommend for all single-project (single-tenant) setups. Default: `true`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__RESERVED_NAMESPACES`    | `system,examples`          | Reserved Namespaces that cannot be created via the REST interface                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `LAKEKEEPER__METRICS_PORT`           | `9000`                     | Port where the metrics endpoint is reachable. Default: `9000`                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `LAKEKEEPER__LISTEN_PORT`            | `8080`                     | Port the server listens on. Default: `8080`                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `LAKEKEEPER__SECRET_BACKEND`         | `postgres`                 | The secret backend to use. If `kv2` is chosen, you need to provide additional parameters found under []() Default: `postgres`, one-of: [`postgres`, `kv2`]                                                                                                                |

### Self-signed certificates in dependencies (e.g. minio)

You may be running Lakekeeper in your own environment which uses self-signed certificates for e.g. minio. Lakekeeper is built with reqwest's `rustls-tls-native-roots` feature activated, this means `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` are respected. If both are not set, the system's default CA store is used. If you want to use a custom CA store, set `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the path of the CA file or `SSL_CERT_DIR` to the path of the CA directory. The certificate used by the server cannot be a CA. It needs to be an end entity certificate, else you may run into `CaUsedAsEndEntity` errors.

### Task queues

Currently, the catalog uses two task queues, one to ultimately delete soft-deleted tabulars and another to purge tabulars which have been deleted with the `purgeRequested=True` query parameter. The task queues are configured as follows:

| Variable                                  | Example | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LAKEKEEPER__QUEUE_CONFIG__MAX_RETRIES`   | 5       | Number of retries before a task is considered failed Default: 5                                             |
| `LAKEKEEPER__QUEUE_CONFIG__MAX_AGE`       | 3600    | Amount of seconds before a task is considered stale and could be picked up by another worker. Default: 3600 |
| `LAKEKEEPER__QUEUE_CONFIG__POLL_INTERVAL` | 10      | Amount of seconds between polling for new tasks. Default: 10                                                |

The queues are currently implemented using the `sqlx` Postgres backend. If you want to use a different backend, you need to implement the `TaskQueue` trait.

### Postgres

Configuration parameters if Postgres is used as a backend, you may either provide connection strings or use the `PG_*` environment variables, connection strings take precedence:

| Variable                                  | Example                                               | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ`        | `postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/iceberg` | Postgres Database connection string used for reading                                                                                     |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE`       | `postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/iceberg` | Postgres Database connection string used for writing.                                                                                    |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`           | `<This is unsafe, please set a proper key>`           | If `LAKEKEEPER__SECRET_BACKEND=postgres`, this key is used to encrypt secrets. It is required to change this for production deployments. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_READ_POOL_CONNECTIONS`    | `10`                                                  | Number of connections in the read pool                                                                                                   |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_WRITE_POOL_CONNECTIONS`   | `5`                                                   | Number of connections in the write pool                                                                                                  |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_HOST_R`                   | `localhost`                                           | Hostname for read operations                                                                                                             |

### KV2 (HCP Vault)

Configuration parameters if a KV2 compatible storage is used as a backend. Currently, we only support the `userpass` authentication method. You may provide the envs as single values like `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__URL=http://vault.local` etc. or as a compound value like:
`LAKEKEEPER__KV2='{url="http://localhost:1234", user="test", password="test", secret_mount="secret"}'`

| Variable                        | Example               | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__URL`          | `https://vault.local` | URL of the KV2 backend                           |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__USER`         | `admin`               | Username to authenticate against the KV2 backend |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__PASSWORD`     | `password`            | Password to authenticate against the KV2 backend |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__SECRET_MOUNT` | `kv/data/iceberg`     | Path to the secret mount in the KV2 backend      |

### Nats

If you want the server to publish events to a NATS server, set the following environment variables:

| Variable                      | Example                 | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_ADDRESS`    | `nats://localhost:4222` | The URL of the NATS server to connect to                             |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_TOPIC`      | `iceberg`               | The subject to publish events to                                     |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_USER`       | `test-user`             | User to authenticate against nats, needs `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_PASSWORD` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_PASSWORD`   | `test-password`         | Password to authenticate against nats, needs `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_USER` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_CREDS_FILE` | `/path/to/file.creds`   | Path to a file containing nats credentials                           |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_TOKEN`      | `xyz`                   | Nats token to authenticate against server                            |

### Kafka

Lakekeeper uses [rust-rdkafka](https://github.com/fede1024/rust-rdkafka) to enable publishing events to Kafka.

The following features of rust-rdkafka are enabled:

- tokio
- ztstd
- gssapi-vendored
- curl-static
- ssl-vendored
- libz-static

This means that all features of [librdkafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka) are usable. All necessary dependencies are statically linked and cannot be disabled. If you want to use dynamic linking or disable a feature, you'll have to fork Lakekeeper and change the features accordingly. Please refer to the documentation of rust-rdkafka for details on how to enable dynamic linking or disable certain features.

To publish events to Kafka, set the following environment variables:

| Variable                        | Example                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_TOPIC`       | `lakekeeper`                                                              | The topic to which events are published                                                                                                                                                 |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG`      | `{"bootstrap.servers"="host1:port,host2:port","security.protocol"="SSL"}` | [librdkafka Configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) as "Dictionary". Note that you cannot use "JSON-Style-Syntax". Also see notes below |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` | `/path/to/config_file`                                                    | [librdkafka Configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) to be loaded from a file. Also see notes below                                      |

**Notes**

`LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG` and `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` are mutually exclusive and the values are not merged, if both variables are set. In case that both are set, `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG` is used.

A `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` could look like this:

```
{
  "bootstrap.servers"="host1:port,host2:port",
  "security.protocol"="SASL_SSL",
  "sasl.mechanisms"="PLAIN",
}
```

Checking configuration parameters is deferred to `rdkafka`

### OpenID Connect

If you want to limit ac
cess to the API, set `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` to the URI of your OpenID Connect Provider. The catalog will then verify access tokens against this provider. The provider must have the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint under `${LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI}/.well-known/openid-configuration` and the openid-configuration needs to have the `jwks_uri` and `issuer` defined.

If `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is set, every request needs have an authorization header, e.g.

```sh
curl {your-catalog-url}/catalog/v1/transactions/commit -X POST -H "authorization: Bearer {your-token-here}" -H "content-type: application/json" -d ...
```

| Variable                          | Example                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` | `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}` | OpenID Provider URL, with keycloak this is the url pointing to your realm, for Azure App Registration it would be something like `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id-here}/v2.0/`. If this variable is not set, endpoints are **not** secured |
